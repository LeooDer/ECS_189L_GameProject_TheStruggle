"2019/06/07 2:23:33 PM MDT","Really like the feel of the game jump and how you can move while in the air left and right. Being able to jump further while boosting is also a neat addition.","Mainly the UI. The UI needs to be a place where it is more noticable/positioned well.","-Maybe a blocking animation to reduce damage- some of the projectiles are difficult to dodge. 
-Maybe have a state where you are temporarily invincible for a few seconds upon getting hit, and where you can move around freely.","Excellent! :)"
